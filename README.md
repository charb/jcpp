JCPP
====

C++ is a very rich and powerful programming language. 
This set of C++ libraries will allow you to develop in C++ with the same ecosystem than you have in Java : reflection, easy Object marshalling, memory management, ...  

This project was initiated because I wanted to answer different needs :

  1. I wanted to develop with C++. I spent 15 years using Java and I wanted to play again with C++
  
  2. I wanted to solve Java/C++ interoperability. 
  It is solved all around us in different ways, but in each case we just solve a part of the problem, not all the problems at once
  
  3. I was frustrated with the language and the few opensource projects that once can find

Ideally with every JDK version there should be a JCPP version provided, and I would be more than happy if Oracle thinks so ...

Check the wiki for more detailed info, lots of documentation should follow.

License: contact if interested. Still working on it but it should be very friendly
