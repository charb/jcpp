- [DONE] re-implement function parameters list with AST interfaces OR add a corresponding AST node object to CPPMethodParameter class
- [NO] for all variables/fields/params ensure corresponding class has a method to return file path and return computed insertion point
- [DONE] have way to indicate if variable/etc. is pointer + have way to indicate if variable/etc. is static (what about other modifiers?) (Create class CPPType)
- [DONE] find how global/static variables are described in AST (add them to CPPFile)
- [DONE] handle overloaded methods.
- [DONE] insert code for constructor. after "colon" initialization block.

- find how object instantiation not directly assigned to variables are described in AST (i.e. "return new MyObject()", "myFunction(new MyObject())")
